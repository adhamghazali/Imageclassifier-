Image-Classifier
================
To run this program you need: 

1-python 2.7.
2-liblinear.
3-PIL.

This program trains a logistic regression classifier to differentiate between images.
Simply put your data in the data/train Directory as specified and type: 

python training.py.

To test the classier. put new images in the data/test dir and type:

python classify.py.


The training consists of: 


1	extracting dense SIFT features from all training images.
2	Saving data to file.
3	Feeding the Logistic regression model with data.
4	Saving the model.


Testing consists of:

1	Extracting dense SIFT from a test image.
2	testing the saved model with the test image.
3	Output : predicted labels.
